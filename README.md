# My profile
Hi everyone! My name is Rachel (she/her), and I'm a 2nd year concentrating in TPP. I'm from Palm Springs, CA and went to UT Austin for undergrad. I'm particularly interested in transportation financing, active transportation, and shared mobility. 
I mostly spend my freetime exploring LA, thrifting, eating good food, and playing with my dog Ollie!

# Course Description and Objectives
In this course, we will utilize Python to visualize data and harness spatial analysis to understand planning issues. I'm looking forward to becoming confident with Python and GIS in general, since I have a little bit of experience that I'd like to brush up on. I'm also excited to utilize the skills I learn in this course in my capstone project!
# Project Ideas
I'm interested in mapping the distribution of EV adoption, CO2 emissions, and transportation costs on a national scale and throughout CA. I'm hoping to use this data visualization to support my capstone on EV participation in a mandatory road user charge system!
